UDACITY GIT & GITHUB COURSE - LESSON 1
--------------------------------------
Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A: You don't have to go through all the lines of the code manually and diff gives you a list of all the differences in the file. THerefore, diff is more efficient as there is less code that you have to go through to spot the bug/typo/mistake. 
--------------------------------------
Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: Because you can see what changes you have done over the time, spot a bug in the process, track the progress of your code and possibly restore some older versions that worked better than your current version. 
--------------------------------------
Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A: Pros: You choose your own pace, control logical changes and you hopefully know what the changes are supposed to do. 
Cons: You may forget to save, lose track of intermediate useful versions before your end result, have to cope with technical issues (e.g. power failure)
--------------------------------------
Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: Because it's often more useful and 'neater' to group many files together when you work on a project as it is quite probable that the files are interrelated and changes in one file affect the other files as well. It saves time and allows grouping when this is appropriate for the project you are working on (e.g. a webpage with multiple files.)
--------------------------------------
Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A: Git log command gives you a history of all the commits in the current repository with the ID, the author and the short description for each commit. Git diff gives you all the differences between two commits (colorised text indicates different types of changes - good for readability).
--------------------------------------
Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A: The history of the repository and all the individual commits can be restored when you use a version control system. So, you can experiment/explore as much as you like and then go through previous versions to track down a bug or re-introduce features that were in previous versions of your code. This can be of great help. 
--------------------------------------
Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A: I would like to use Git to interact with GitHub and contribute to public repositories, solve my own little problems efficiently by keeping track of different versions and start working on different projects to build up my portfolio as a web developer.
